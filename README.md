Dear,

This is COGNOSPHERE PTE. LTD. We are here to report a few infringing repositories on Github. Without our authorization, the links identified herein contain and display openly the codes/source codes of our game package, which have constituted as a copyright infringement as well as a violation of the Terms of Service of the game.

The infringing URLs are:

[https://github.com/Chito-Group/Bkebi-GC](https://github.com/Chito-Group/Bkebi-GC)

We find that the “cheat library” folder in this repository contains our codes. Check [https://github.com/Chito-Group/Bkebi-GC/tree/bkebi-new/cheat-library/src/appdata](https://github.com/Chito-Group/Bkebi-GC/tree/bkebi/cheat-library/src/appdata) for example.

Meanwhile, we reported an identical repository before and it was removed by Github [invalid]. We suspect this one is a fork.

The infringement has caused a great harm to us. We request a permanent removal of the repositories.

Many thanks!

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

The entire repositories we mentioned above should be removed or made private.
